// Absolutely! Here's your updated report with **single asterisk markdown** as requested and 2-point bullets in plain text:

// ---

// ### *Report*

// *Accuracy*  
// - Correctly identified and addressed the root cause of multiple PHP runtime errors.  
// - Used accurate PHP syntax and standard functions (e.g., `ftok`, `shmop_open`) to replace undefined or incorrect ones.  

// *Making Sense / Coherence*  
// - Clear reasoning was provided to explain why each error occurred and how the fix works.  
// - The logical flow from error trace → cause → fix was maintained consistently.  

// *Instruction Following*  
// - Fully followed your instruction to generate the *entire fixed code* when requested.  
// - Provided responses in the format and tone you repeatedly specified, including markdown usage.  

// *Completeness*  
// - Each relevant issue in the trace (e.g., undefined function, type casting error, missing files) was addressed.  
// - No partial or skipped explanations — all details needed for a working version were included.  

// *Efficiency & Optimality*  
// - Minimal, targeted changes were made to avoid disrupting existing logic or structure.  
// - Solutions were efficient for local system access (e.g., memory diagnostics) using supported OS-level tools.  

// *Presentation / Clarity & Style*  
// - Markdown structure was used properly (`*`, `-`, etc.) with clear headers and bullet formatting.  
// - Fixed code and reports were clearly segmented for readability, with consistent indentation and whitespace.  

// *Code Quality & Execution*  
// - Code adheres to PHP best practices for system-level operations like shared memory usage.  
// - Avoided deprecated or undefined functions, ensuring compatibility across platforms like macOS.  

// *Other Issues*  
// - `/proc/meminfo` not available on macOS was explained, and alternatives or mock replacements suggested.  
// - Warned about using `Shmop` on macOS and suggested checking availability before using system-dependent features.
